# MSCS-532-Assignment6

1. As a part of assignment 6, this repo contains 2 files named ,"medians.py" and elementary_data_structure.py
2. Source code should be run by python3.
3. Example: To run 'medians.py' in the terminal we should go to the directory where the file is saved and enter "python3 medians.py"
4. I have also added one of the output file (might be different from mentioned in report) generated from running the program which has been used in report also just in case of need for validation.
5. I have also included the pdf version of report so that mathematical equations could be stable. In fact, as the reports were getting longer I decided to split them into 2 files for different part of assignment.

#Summary of Findings

Part1
In short: the randomized algorithm is faster on average, but the deterministic one is more
predictable and steady, handling even the worst-case inputs without much fluctuation.

Part2
Use arrays when we need fast, indexed access and know our data size ahead of time.
Stacks are perfect for handling recursive processes or situations where we need to
backtrack.
Queues are the best choice for tasks that need to be processed in order, like jobs in a
printer queue.
Linked lists are great for when we need dynamic memory management and frequent
insertions/deletions, but access time isn't crucial.
Matrices are ideal for 2D data structures or when we're doing heavy-duty mathematical
computations.
